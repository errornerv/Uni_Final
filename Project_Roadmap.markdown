**Goal**: Transform the web panel into an interactive, modern, and user-friendly dashboard that impresses users and showcases real-time data.

**Tasks**:

1. **Add Real-Time Dashboard**:
   - Implement a Chart.js-based dashboard in `index.html` to display real-time traffic volume, congestion levels, and network health from `real_time_orders.db`.
   - Add API endpoint in `app.py` to fetch real-time data every 5 seconds.
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.
2. **Interactive Form for Orders**:
   - Create a form in `index.html` to add new orders to the blockchain (integrate with `code04_blockchain_with_new_orders.py`).
   - Add backend logic in `app.py` to process form submissions and update `new_orders.db`.
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.
3. **Improve Report Filtering**:
   - Add filtering options (e.g., by timestamp, node, or congestion level) to `report.html` using DataTables.js or custom JavaScript.
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 days.
4. **Modernize UI/UX**:
   - Replace Bootstrap with Tailwind CSS in `styles.css`, `index.html`, and `report.html` for a sleeker look.
   - Optimize mobile responsiveness (e.g., sidebar behavior on small screens).
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.

**Success Criteria**:

- Dashboard displays real-time charts with traffic and congestion data.
- Users can submit new orders via a form and see them in reports.
- Reports are filterable and sortable.
- UI is modern, responsive, and visually appealing.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Handling real-time data updates without overloading the server.
- Ensuring form submissions are secure (e.g., input validation).

## Phase 2: Blockchain Optimization (Make it Robust and Scalable) 

**Goal**: Enhance the blockchain system to be more secure, efficient, and feature-rich.

**Tasks**:

1. **Advanced Proof-of-Stake**:
   - Improve Proof-of-Stake in `code01_blockchain_initial_data.py` by adding node weighting based on capacity or history.
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.
2. **Signature Validation**:
   - Add signature verification in `code02_blockchain_congestion_improved.py` and `code03_blockchain_managed_traffic.py` to prevent block tampering.
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.
3. **New Transaction Type**:
   - Introduce a "priority traffic" transaction type in `code04_blockchain_with_new_orders.py` or `code05_blockchain_with_real_time_orders.py`.
   - Update database schemas and web reports to support the new transaction.
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.
4. **Realistic Simulation**:
   - Enhance traffic simulation in `code05_blockchain_with_real_time_orders.py` using statistical distributions (e.g., Poisson for traffic volume).
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.

**Success Criteria**:

- Proof-of-Stake considers node capacity for validator selection.
- Blocks are validated for signatures before processing.
- New transaction type is functional and visible in reports.
- Simulated traffic data mimics real-world patterns.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Balancing security with performance in signature validation.
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing database schemas.

## Phase 3: Smart Management and Self-Healing (Make it Intelligent)

**Goal**: Upgrade smart traffic management and self-healing to be fully automated and data-driven.

**Tasks**:

1. **Integrate ML Model**:
   - Use the RandomForest model from `code07_model_training.py` in `code09_smart_traffic_management.py` and `self_healing_network.py` for real-time decision-making (e.g., traffic rerouting).
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.
2. **Dynamic Self-Healing**:
   - Adjust node reactivation probability in `self_healing_network.py` based on historical data or network health.
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 days.
3. **Optimize Resource Usage**:
   - Replace threading with asyncio in `code09_smart_traffic_management.py` to reduce CPU usage.
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.

**Success Criteria**:

- ML model drives traffic rerouting and node reactivation decisions.
- Self-healing adapts to network conditions dynamically.
- Smart management runs efficiently with minimal resource consumption.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Ensuring ML model predictions are fast enough for real-time use.
- Debugging asyncio transitions from threading.

## Phase 4: Data Analysis and Reporting (Make it Insightful)

**Goal**: Create advanced, interactive reports and real-time predictions to provide deep insights.

**Tasks**:

1. **Real-Time Congestion Prediction**:
   - Integrate `code07_model_training.py` with `code05_blockchain_with_real_time_orders.py` to predict congestion in real-time.
   - Display predictions in the web dashboard.
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.
2. **Interactive Reports**:
   - Move `code08_advanced_traffic_report.py` outputs to the web panel using Plotly for interactive charts (e.g., daily traffic trends).
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.
3. **Export Options**:
   - Add PDF/Excel export for reports in `report.html` using libraries like `reportlab` or `openpyxl`.
   - Estimated Time: 2 days.

**Success Criteria**:

- Real-time congestion predictions are accurate and displayed in the dashboard.
- Web reports include interactive charts for traffic and health metrics.
- Users can download reports in PDF or Excel formats.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Managing large datasets for interactive charts.
- Ensuring export formats are user-friendly.

**Tasks**:

1. **Enhance README**:
   - Update `README.md` with sections for Features, Demo, Screenshots, Installation, and Usage.
   - Add a project demo video or GIF.
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 days.
2. **Add Unit Tests**:
   - Write pytest tests for key functions in `src/` (e.g., block creation, congestion detection).
   - Estimated Time: 2-3 days.
3. **Set Up CI/CD**:
   - Create a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and deployment.
   - Estimated Time: 1-2 days.
4. **Fix Performance Issues**:
