Network Traffic Problem Solve Using Blockchain

Project Description
This project, developed at the request of Professor Karimi from Islamic Azad University of Tabriz, provides a blockchain-based solution for managing and optimizing network traffic issues. Leveraging blockchain technology, it simulates, analyzes, and manages network traffic, incorporating features such as self-healing, intelligent optimization, and advanced traffic reporting. All rights to this code belong to Ali Samadian. The project consists of two main components:

Blockchain: For recording and managing traffic data in blocks.
Traffic: For analyzing data, training machine learning models, and generating advanced reports.

Create the virtual environment (if it doesn't exist):
bash

Copy
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
bash

Copy
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install Required Packages:
Install the project dependencies:
bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Files:
Execute the files in the following order (from the src directory):
blockchain/:
01_blockchain_initial_data.py
02_blockchain_congestion_improved.py
03_blockchain_managed_traffic.py
04_blockchain_with_new_orders.py
05_blockchain_with_real_time_orders.py

08_advanced_traffic_report.py
smart/:
09_smart_traffic_management.py
self_healing_network.py
For example, to run 01_blockchain_initial_data.py:
bash

Copy
python start/src/blockchain/01_blockchain_initial_data.py
Running the Web Panel:
Navigate to the web directory:
bash

Copy
cd c:\Users\Error\Desktop\project\network traffic problem solve using blockchain\start\web
Run the web panel:
bash

Copy
python app.py
The web panel will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
Usage
Blockchain: Stores and manages network traffic data in blocks.
Traffic: Analyzes data, trains machine learning models, and generates advanced reports.
Smart Management: Optimizes traffic and implements self-healing capabilities.
Web Panel: Allows running scripts and viewing reports via a web browser.
Run a script: http://localhost:5000/run_script/<script_id>
View a report: http://localhost:5000/report/<script_id>
Complete Stop: The "Complete Stop" button at the bottom of the page stops all running scripts. The loading animation will also stop once all scripts are terminated.
