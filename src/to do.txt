2. Error Handling
Database Operations: Add robust error handling for database operations (e.g., retries for locked databases, better exception messages).
Script Failures: Ensure all scripts gracefully handle unexpected errors and log them properly.

3. Performance Optimization
Threading and Concurrency: Some scripts (e.g., code05_blockchain_with_real_time_orders.py) use threading. Ensure proper thread management to avoid memory leaks or race conditions.
Database Access: Optimize database queries by indexing frequently queried columns (e.g., node_id, timestamp).

4. Modularization
Shared Graph Logic: The graph structure (nodes and graph) is defined in multiple scripts. Move this logic to a shared module (e.g., graph_utils.py) to avoid duplication.
Shared Configurations: Centralize configurations like database paths, thresholds, and constants in a single file (e.g., config.py).

5. Documentation
Inline Comments: Add more detailed comments in complex sections of the code for better understanding.
Docstrings: Ensure all functions and classes have proper docstrings explaining their purpose and parameters.

6. Testing
Unit Tests: Add unit tests for critical functions (e.g., generate_simulated_traffic, add_block, analyze_network_health_impact).
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between blockchain, traffic, and smart modules to ensure they work seamlessly.

7. Advanced Features
Dynamic Thresholds: In code09_smart_traffic_management.py, thresholds are updated dynamically. Ensure this logic is well-tested and doesn't introduce instability.
Real-Time Monitoring: Enhance real-time monitoring scripts (e.g., self_healing_network.py) to provide more detailed logs or visualizations.

8. Cleanup
Unused Imports: Remove unused imports from all scripts to improve readability and reduce potential issues.
Dead Code: Identify and remove any unused or commented-out code that is no longer relevant.

9. Security
Database Access: Ensure database files are secured and not accessible to unauthorized users.
Sensitive Data: Avoid hardcoding sensitive data (e.g., keys, secrets) in the code.

10. Scalability
Large Data Handling: If the database grows significantly, consider using more scalable solutions (e.g., PostgreSQL) instead of SQLite.
Distributed Processing: For heavy computations, explore distributed processing frameworks like Apache Kafka or Celery.
